Trying something new... For those unaware, all of Pop!_OS software development is on [github.com/pop-os](https://github.com/pop-os) and you can track which packages are updated each week by following the [pop-os/repo-release](https://github.com/pop-os/repo-release) repository.

Of course, not everyone has the time to follow these this repository or can easily parse what it all means, so here is my humble initial attempt of summarizing and highlighting the changes for the week (note, I will not list all the changes, just the ones that I think are interesting or noteworthy... I will also be skipping all the COSMIC related packages as most people are not using those yet).

## [July 24, 2023](https://github.com/pop-os/repo-release/pull/261)

- **nvidia-graphics-drivers**: Updated from `525.116.04` to `535.86.05`

- **system76-acpi-dkms**: Modify behavior regarding keyboard LEDs

## [July 25, 2023](https://github.com/pop-os/repo-release/pull/262)

- **system76-power**: Tweaks for the `bonw15`, particularly regarding hibernate, resume, and suspend

## [July 26, 2023](https://github.com/pop-os/repo-release/pull/263)

- **desktop**: Reorganize meta-packages into 4 levels:

    1. **pop-container-runtime**
    2. **pop-container-interactive**
    3. **pop-server**
    4. **pop-desktop**

    **ubuntu-minimal** is replaced by **pop-container-runtime**, and **ubuntu-standard** is replaced by **pop-container-interactive**.

## [July 27, 2023](https://github.com/pop-os/repo-release/pull/264)

- **desktop**: Remove conflict between **pop-de-gnome** and **sddm**

By far the biggest change is the metapackage reorganization and it will be interesting to see where that leads.

Final note, this is only concerning the Pop!_OS specific package updates.  You will most likely also receive updates from Ubuntu... which I failed to track this week and so I didn't list here.  I may try to do that in the future.

Feel free to let me know what you think of the idea of a weekly package summary or share your experiences with this week's updates!
